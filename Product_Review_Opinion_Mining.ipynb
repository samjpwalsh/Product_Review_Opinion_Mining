    "The feature extraction task is concerned with defining which product features are being described in the reviews and additionally extracting sentiment bearing words. The sentiment detection task is then concerned with determining the polarity of reviews (whether sentiment is positive or negative towards the extracted features).\n",

    "The 17 text files provided follow broadly the same structure, with review sentences being divided by with the characters '##'. Text before these characters denotes annotations which are used as the \"Gold Standard\" product features and sentiment for this analysis. Text after these characters denotes the review sentences themselves. In this analysis I consider the following information from the files:\n",
    "- The Gold Standard product features\n",
    "- The Gold Standard sentiment attached to the product features (though only the polarity, positive or negative)\n",
    "- The sentence itself from which features and sentiment bearing words are extracted, and sentiment detected\n",

    "Next, I look to extract product features and sentiment-bearing words from the \"Sentence\" column. Pre-processing is performed first to standardise the data as much as possible. During this step, several procedures are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sentence is converted to lowercase - this helps in all future steps of the process, as it ensures that if two words are the same, they will be counted as such, regardless of the case used.\n",
    "- The sentence is tokenized using Spacy's NLP pipeline to seperate out individual parts-of-speech.\n",
    "- Punctuation is removed as it is not likely to be a part of a product feature nor be indicative of sentiment. There may be some exceptions to this, for example, exlamation marks could indicate enthusiasm, but they could equally indicate anger. I have chosen to focus on the words themselves in this analysis as they are more likely to clearly indicate either positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "- Stopwords are also removed - while they are required to make a sentence readable, they are not likely to either be product features (generally nouns) or sentiment-bearing words (generally adjectives).\n",
    "- Words are lemmatised - again this is to help standardise the words to be analysed so product features and sentiment can more easily be detected. Lemmatisation rather than stemming is more appropriate here as it is important that full (not stemmed) words are extracted as product features to aid readability in the product and feature summaries. \n",

    "- Spacy's chunking algorithm is applied to identify noun-phrases\n",

From observations in the data, it is clear that although many sentences contain possible features, it is only a subset of these that display sentiment towards those features. Therefore, it is necessary to extract words that are likely to determine sentiment so the algorithm can be applied selectively to those sentences, reducing the possibility that sentences are labelled as having positive or negative sentiment where no sentiment is actually present."

    "Now that sentiment bearing product features have been extracted from the dataset, I use a supervised learning approach (using sklearn's Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm) to determine whether sentiment is positive or negative. I use the Gold Standard sentiments provided and the cleaned sentence text to train the model, and apply this at a sentence level (ie not considering differing sentiment in the same sentence for two different product features), which would be an interesting additional approach analysis to be explored in the future. I chose Naive Bayes as it's bag-of-words approach tends to perform well in binary classification tasks, especially sentiment analysis.\n",

    "A quirk of the dataset is that the Gold Standard features and sentiment do not necessarily match the extracted sentiment bearing features (ie some extracted features are not labelled in the data and some labelled data are not extracted). In this case I only consider sentences with both extracted sentiment bearing features, and Gold Standard features and sentiment. This does somewhat reduce the size of the training/testing set, however there is enough overlap to generate a decent size dataset for all products.\n",

Throughout I have used the evaluation methods of Precision and Recall for feature extraction, and accuracy for sentiment prediction. \n",

    "In the future I could look to develop this approach further. While I am confident that Naive Bayes is a good choice of algorithm for the task, the feature extraction step could be further refined with additional pruning steps or by merging features with similar meanings, perhaps using semantic modelling. Additionallly a more sophisticated approach for identifying sentiment words could be taken (rather than adjective extraction), for example, dependency parsing could identify references to particular features, which could then be extracted for further analysis."
